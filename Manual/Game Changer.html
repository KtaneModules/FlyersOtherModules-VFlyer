                    <p>This module consists of a 6 row, 3 column grid, a binary counter of 3 LEDs, a green submit button, and a red reset button.</p>
                    <p>To solve the module, solve the 6 row, 3 column Game of Life grid for each iteration. The rules for this game are different to the normal Game of Life.</p>
					<p>Take the first 9 tiles in reading order. Ordered from 0 - 8 inclusive, tiles that are white will correspond to how many white tiles must surround a tile to turn a black tile into a white tile.</p>
					<p>Then take the first 9 tiles in <strong>reverse</strong> reading order. Ordered from 0 - 8 inclusive, tiles that are white will correspond to how many white tiles must surround a tile to keep a tile white.</p>
					<p>Using the current board and the determined conditions, iterate the displayed board</p>
                    <p>The module will solve when 8 iterations are submitted correctly or when the next iteration to submit is the same as the current board.</p>
