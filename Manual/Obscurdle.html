                <h2>On the Subject of Obscurdle</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">If guessing words is supposed to be fun, why put in an obstruction?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A random quirk has been applied on this module. Determine the quirk applied and the correct word(s) to disarm this module.</li>
                    <li>To query a word, spell it out by pressing the buttons labeled with that letter, and press the ENTER button. The button labeled BACK will delete the last letter from your input. The physical keyboard may be used to input those letters instead.</li>
                    <li>All queries must be valid words. Failing to query a valid word, or querying a word that is not five letters long will prompt a warning to the defuser. <strong>Repeating a word that has already been queried WILL result in a strike.</strong></li>
                    <li>Normally, 1 word must be guessed correctly to disarm the module and the result of the word would be displayed as the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Green (Orange if colorblind is enabled): The letter is present in the answer, and in correct position.</li>
                            <li>Yellow (Blue if colorblind is enabled): The letter is present in the answer, but NOT in correct position.</li>
                            <li>Gray: The letter is not present in the answer.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>The quirk applied is exactly one of these possible quirks, categorized as the following:<ul>
                        <li>Symble: The response is flipped so that the word you guessed is treated as the answer and the answer is treated as a guess. In addition, other colors will show up that do not represent Wordle. If colorblind mode is enabled, symbols will show up overlaying the letters.</li>
                        <li>Xordle: Two words, that have no letters in common, will need to be guessed correctly. Each word guessed will show the "xored" result from the two correct words. Successfully finding one word will make the module behave like Wordle until the other word is found.</li>
                        <li>Fibble: Exactly one letter in each word you guess will lie about its result. All other letters will behave normally.</li>
                        <li>5-0-0: All colors will be in a sequence. These will only show in the correct word how many letters are, in the correct position, absent, or not in the correct position.</li>
                        <li>Warmle: The response is modified in accordance to the alphabetic position of each letter in the word queried to each letter in the correct answer. This response wraps around in the alphabet. Queried letters marked with "present in the answer, but NOT in correct position" will instead denote that the alphabetic position is within 3 letters, inclusive, from the correct letter. Likewise, queried letters marked with "not present in the answer" have the correct letter's alphabetic position more than 3 letters away.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You may view past queries by pressing the up and down arrows, on the module, or the physical keyboard.</li>
                </ul>
