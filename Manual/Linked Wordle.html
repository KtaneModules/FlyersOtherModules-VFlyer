                    <h2>On the Subject of Linked Wordle</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">I'm supposed to guess a word. This is easy right- wait. Why do all of these have the same word typed in?</p>
					<p>This module consists of a keyboard and a 5-row, 6-column empty black grid.</p>
					<p>To disarm this module, enter in the correct 5-letter word within a given amount of attempts.</p>
					<p>The number of attempts given on Linked Wordle starts at 6 and increases with every <a href="#">Linked Wordle</a> present on the bomb.</p>
					<p>Use the keyboard to input the word. The on-screen keyboard may be used instead to type in the word. <strong>The word typed in will be shared between each unsolved module.</strong> Pressing enter will submit that word, while backspace will delete the last letter in the word. An invalid 5-letter word will have letters marked in red.</p>
					<p>Failure to find the correct word within the given amount of attempts for each Linked Wordle will start a 30 second cooldown between each attempt, which will increase for every failed attempt. After the cooldown expires, a new batch of words for the unsolved Linked Wordles is assigned alongside the number attempts for the remaining.</p>
					<p>Like the Wordle counterpart:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Gray letters represent that the letter is NOT present in the solution word.</li>
						<li>Yellow letters represent that the letter in the solution word is present BUT not in the correct position.</li>
						<li>Green letters represent that the letter in the solution word is present AND in the correct position.</li>
					</ul>
