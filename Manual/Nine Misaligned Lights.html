					<p>This module consists of a 3 by 3 set of selectable tiles with a 3 x 3 display at the center. To disarm the module, the defuser will need to go through 3 stages of examining and interacting that tile. Each stage is separated in the manual provided, giving different instructions for each.</p>
					<h3>Stage 1: 0 - 9</h3>
					<p>To complete this stage, the defuser will need to align all 9 tiles in such a way that the indicators in those tiles all point up and then left. However, after getting all of the indicators to point up, they will scramble themselves again in a different manner. Clicking the tile will rotate the tile 90 degrees in one direction and also rotate other tiles in the same direction, marked by the indicator on that tile. The red/green indicator inside the tile behaves like all other indicators in that tile except the fact that it denotes the "up" position. Likewise, the red/green border around a given tile denotes the up position alongside denoting if that tile has the correct orientation or not.</p>
