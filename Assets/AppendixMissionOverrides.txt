Mission Overrides Description Appendix
Overriding 7:
- Syntax: "[7Override] Capped/Uncapped/Choice"
-- Capped: Caps 7 to the 8 stages max
-- Uncapped: Uncaps 7 to generate as many stages as possible.
-- Choice: Allows settings for this module. (Same as if the module was detected in some other mission with no overrides)
Overriding Labeled Priorities Plus:
- Syntax: "[LPPOverride] ##,##,##,##"
-- ## for each represents up to how many variants of this kind before the module rolls randomly for variants, Labeled, Unlabeled, Relabeled, Mislabeled, in this order
-- SETTING THIS VALUE TOO BIG WILL CAUSE IT TO STOP WORKING.
- Syntax: "[LPPOverride] -,Un-,Re-,Mis-,..."
-- "-" adds 1 point of weight to roll for Labeled Priorities.
-- "Un-" adds 1 point of weight to roll for Unlabeled Priorities.
-- "Re-" adds 1 point of weight to roll for Relabeled Priorities.
-- "Mis-" adds 1 point of weight to roll for Mislabeled Priorities.
